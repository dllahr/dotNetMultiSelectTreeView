# dotNetMultiSelectTreeView
Extending the TreeView control in .NET to allow selecting multiple items.  This repository is migrated from SourceForge ".NET Multi-Select TreeView 2":  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mulsel-treeview/?source=typ_redirect

The original / bulk of the work was ".NET Multi-Select TreeView":  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mstreeview/ but I was unable to reach them when I made some bug fixes etc. so I spawned the above SourceForge repo.
